   *
   * This function compares the boat speed from the specified polar against all

   * the given wind conditions. It applies the crossover percentage to give a
   * small bonus to the currently selected polar, which helps prevent excessive
   * sail changes.
   *
   * The crossover percentage creates a "hysteresis" effect, meaning a sail must
   * be significantly faster (by the percentage specified) to trigger a change
   * from the current sail configuration.
   *
   * The function properly handles error conditions and invalid boat speeds (NaN
   * values) when comparing polars to ensure that only valid data is used in the
   * comparison.
   *

   * typically 40 knots) are treated as special cases where no polar can claim
   * to be "fastest".

   * This function builds a "CrossOverRegion" for each polar (sail
   * configuration), which defines the exact wind conditions (combinations of
   * wind angle and wind speed) where that particular sail configuration is
   * optimal. These regions are used during routing to automatically select the
   * most appropriate sail for the current conditions.

   * 3. Finding the boundaries where the optimal sail changes
   * 4. Constructing a polygon that encloses all conditions where this sail is
   * fastest
   * 5. Simplifying the polygon to improve performance
   *
   * The grid uses a resolution of 1/8 knot for wind speed and 1/8 degree for
   * wind angle, allowing for precise definition of crossover boundaries while
   * maintaining reasonable computational performance.

  /**
   * Finds the most suitable polar (sail configuration) for the given weather
   * and sailing conditions.
   *
   * The selection is based on the "CrossOverContour" for each polar, which
   * defines the valid ranges of wind speeds and angles for that particular sail
   * configuration. In sailing, different sail configurations (e.g., full main +
   * jib, reefed main, spinnaker, etc.) perform optimally in different
   * conditions. This function helps the routing algorithm automatically select
   * the appropriate sail configuration based on the current wind and course.
   *
   * This function follows a multi-step process to select the optimal polar.
   * 1. Check if the current polar is still valid for the conditions. If so,
   *    it's retained for continuity.
   * 2. If current polar is invalid, tries to find any suitable polar from the
   *    available set.
   * 3. If no polar meets the conditions perfectly, implements a fallback
   *    strategy based on the specific limitation:
   *    - When wind is too light, selects the polar with minimum wind speed
   *      requirements closest to the current wind.
   *    - When sailing too close to the wind, finds polars that can sail at the
   *      lowest angles. This could happen while tacking.
   *    - When sailing too far downwind, finds polars that can handle the
   *      highest angles. This could happen while jibing.
   *
   * Each candidate polar receives a score based on its suitability, with the
   * current polar given a slight preference (10% bonus) if it's a viable
   * option. Find the best polar for the weather conditions.
   *
   * @param curpolar Index of the current polar being used, or -1 if no polar is
   * selected yet
   * @param tws True Wind Speed (TWS) in knots
   * @param twa True Wind Angle (TWA), i.e., heading relative to true wind
   * direction in degrees.
   * @param swell Swell height in meters (reserved for future use, currently not
   * used in selection)
   * @param optimize_tacking Whether to optimize the tacking angle for upwind
   * sailing
   * @param status Pointer to a PolarSpeedStatus variable to receive detailed
   * status information. If nullptr, status details are not returned. On
   * success, *status is set to POLAR_SPEED_SUCCESS.
   *
   * @return The index of the valid polar to use, or -1 if no valid polar was
   * found. If curpolar is still valid, it will be returned to avoid unnecessary
   * sail changes. If curpolar is invalid but another polar is valid, the index
   * of that polar is returned. If no valid polar is found, -1 is returned,
   * indicating that sailing is not possible with the available sail
   * configurations in the given conditions.
