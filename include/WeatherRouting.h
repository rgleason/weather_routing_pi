 *
 * This class manages multiple route calculations, configuration UI, position

 * The class serves as the central coordinator between the following components:
 * - Route map overlays (RouteMapOverlay) - The actual route computation
 * - Weather routes (WeatherRoute) - The UI representation of routes
 * - Positions (RouteMapPosition) - Start/end locations for routes
 * - Dialog interfaces - For configuration and display of route information
 *
 * Weather routing calculations are performed in background threads managed by
 * this class. The routing data can be exported to OpenCPN routes and displayed
 * on the chart.
